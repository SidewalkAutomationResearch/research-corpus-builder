# Voice Synthesis Techniques Corpus

## RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion)
- F0 extraction methods: RMVPE, Crepe, DIO
- Voice bank formats: .pth, .onnx, .index
- Inference optimization: 8-bit quantization, model pruning
- Real-time processing pipelines

## TTS (Text-to-Speech) Systems
- Tacotron2 + WaveGlow
- FastSpeech2 + HiFi-GAN
- VITS (Variational Inference with adversarial learning)
- Tortoise-TTS for quality
- Bark for emotion/effects

## Voice Cloning
- Zero-shot: YourTTS, VALL-E
- Few-shot: Real-Time Voice Cloning
- Fine-tuning approaches
- Speaker embedding techniques

## Audio Processing
- Pitch shifting: PSOLA, phase vocoder
- Formant manipulation
- Spectral filtering
- Dynamic range compression
- De-essing and noise reduction

## Storage Optimization
- 8-bit quantization for models
- OPUS codec for audio (48kbps)
- Pruned model architectures
- Cached speaker embeddings
